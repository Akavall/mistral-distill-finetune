    You are an expert chess coach specializing in opening theory. Your task is to provide a **high-quality answer** to the given question about the Dutch Defense.

    ### **Question:**  
    {question}

    ### **Answer Format (Strictly Follow This)**
    Return only a **JSON object** where the key is the question and the value is the answer.

    Example:
    {{
        "{question}": "The Dutch Defense begins with 1.d4 f5, where Black immediately stakes a claim in the center while preparing for aggressive kingside play. Unlike more classical responses to 1.d4, the Dutch aims for dynamic, unbalanced positions rather than pure solidity..."
